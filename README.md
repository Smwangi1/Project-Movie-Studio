# Project-Movie-Studio
The company i work for wants to create original video content and they have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of the company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
## Methodology
This project will be accomplished Using two datasets which are the Tmdb Movie and bom_movie gross dataset in which I will use Data cleaning process towards each individual dataset and then merge them together and use data cleaning processes, data visulization techniques, recommendations and conclusion in order to achieve the Objective. I have 3 Pdfs which contain a presentation, a dashboard and the coding.
